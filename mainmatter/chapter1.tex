\section{Overview of CHIP at Purdue}

\subsection{Strengths}

It has a huge database of problems from multiple textbooks
It already has the ability to collect statistics (underutilized)
It has a specialized instructor GUI
It has huge archives of past student data
There is no cost to the students
There is a lot of past experience using the site (faculty and IT)
There is a dedicated question and answer system
A dedicated staff handles bugs
It is on location in the physics building
It has no ties to other companies, businesses, buildings, people, etc.
It is self-contained

\subsection{Weaknesses}

It has an out of date look
Hints are underutilized
There are no interactive graphics
We need more graphs related to learning outcomes
Uploading stuff is a pain
It has no ties to other companies, businesses, buildings, people, etc.
