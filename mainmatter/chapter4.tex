\subsection{Force Concept Inventory}

The force concept inventory (􏰀FCI)􏰁 is a multiple choice test that is used to measure a student's understanding of introductory mechanics. It is given at the beginning of an introductory mechanics course as a pre-test and again at the end of the course as a post-test. The pool of answers on the test are designed to correspond to common student misconceptions of mechanics; they were developed through a series of student interviews\cite{hestenes1992}.

Coletta et al. have observed a strong correlation between the normalized gain on the FCI and SAT scores. They go so far as to state that SAT scores might be a good indicator of the expected normalized gains within a classroom\cite{coletta2007}.
