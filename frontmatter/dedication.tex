\chapter[Dedication]{Dedication}

\begin{flushright}
I would like to thank my family for their support and encouragement - my dad for the inspiration to pursue a higher degree, my mom for her compassion and delicious food, my brother for his calming presence, and my sister-in-law for commiserating with me during the tough times.

I would especially like to thank my wife for her support. She stuck with me throughout my entire graduate career, during all of my ups and downs. If that's not love, I don't know what is.
