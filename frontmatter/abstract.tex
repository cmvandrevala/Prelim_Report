\chapter[Abstract]{Abstract}

Building off CPlite from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), Purdue University developed the Computerized Homework in Physics (CHIP) system in 1997. Due to its success at Purdue, we are developing a Computerized Interactive Teaching Assistant (CITA) for the next generation of CHIP. We aim to extend the ideas behind the interactive examples created at UIUC, raising them to a higher level of interaction between the students and the online learning tool, by applying the current findings of multimedia learning and physics education research. Unlike most computerized homework systems for physics that only provide students with a ``correct'' or ``incorrect'' response to their answers, the CITA program will guide students through fundamental concepts and appropriate problem solving techniques. It will provide students with dynamic feedback to their responses, thus allowing them to learn from their mistakes as they analyze each problem.
