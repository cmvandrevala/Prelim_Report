\section{Opening Remarks}

Thank you all for coming today. My name is [MODERATOR] and this is [NOTE TAKER]. We are conducting a study of the effectiveness of the interactive tutorials that you used on the homework this past semester. It is all well and good to update a system based on the test scores, but obviously, that only tells part of the story. You have all been working with the system, so you are the experts. We want to hear your opinions.

We want to hear your honest thoughts and opinions because that is how we can improve the system. I have prepared a set of questions for the session, but feel free to add in any extra comments as we go along. There are no right or wrong answers in this session.

During our discussion [NOTE TAKER] will be taking notes. However, [NOTE TAKER] cannot write down every word we say. With your permission, we would like to record the discussion so that we donâ€™t miss anything that is said. Of course, this discussion will stay confidential and your comments will not affect your course grade in any way. Is it alright with everyone if we record the discussion?

During our discussion please let everyone share their views. Make sure that only one person is speaking at a time so that the recording will be clear. Just join in when you have something to say. If you feel like you want to share more details with me, just let me know after the session. I will schedule a private one-on-one interview at your convenience so you can tell me more about your opinions.

Everything that you hear today should be confidential and not shared with people who are outside the group. It is perfectly fine to disagree with others! This discussion will last about one and a half hours. At the end of the session, we will give you a gift card as a thank you for taking the time to participate in this study.

Please make sure that you turn off all of your cell phones and mobile devices.

Are there any questions before we start?
